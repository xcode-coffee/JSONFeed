         "content_html" : "\n<p>I’ve spent the last week using a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and this is, in many ways, the easiest product review I’ve ever written. There are several significant improvements to the hardware, and <em>no</em> tradeoffs or downsides. There is no “<em>but</em>”.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Display:</strong> The new iPad Pros have the best displays of any computer I’ve ever seen. True Tone plus ProMotion is simply terrific. (The first generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro didn’t have True Tone; with these new models, the only noticeable difference between the 12.9- and 10.5-inch models is the size.) You really do have to see the 120 Hz refresh rate in person &#8212; and play with it while scrolling content on screen &#8212; to get it. You can actually read text as it’s moving during a scroll. It’s not as significant as the jump from non-retina to retina, but it’s in that ballpark.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Pencil:</strong> The latency of the Apple Pencil on a first-generation iPad Pro is the best I had ever seen for any stylus on any device at any price. The latency of the Apple Pencil on the new iPad Pro is so much better &#8212;  so much closer to ink-on-paper imperceptibility &#8212; that you have to try it to believe it. It’s the one thing that really makes the first-gen iPad Pro feel &#8220;slow&#8221;.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Size:</strong> The increase in size is perfect. The footprint for a “regular” iPad has, until now, remained unchanged since the original iPad in 2010. That 9.7-inch display size was nearly perfect. This 10.5-inch display size is better though. Apple said during the keynote that typing on the on-screen keyboard is surprisingly better given just a bit more room, and I agree. And typing on the Smart Keyboard cover is <em>way</em> better than on last year’s 9.7-inch iPad Pro. In hand it doesn’t feel bigger at all. It feels like there were no trade-offs whatsoever in increasing the display size and overall device footprint. Part of that is because the weight has remained completely unchanged. I have had zero problems &#8212; not one &#8212; with the decreased bezel area. Apple’s inadvertent touch detection game is on point.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Battery:</strong> Battery life is great, as expected.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Performance:</strong> Apple’s in-house chip team continues to amaze. No one buys an iPad because of CPU benchmarks, but the new iPad Pro’s CPU performance is mind-boggling. Forget about comparisons to the one-port MacBook &#8212; the iPad Pro blows that machine out of the water performance-wise. The astounding thing is that the new iPad Pro holds its own against the MacBook <em>Pro</em> in single-core performance &#8212; around 3,900 on the Geekbench 4 benchmark for the iPad Pro vs. around 4,200–4,400 for the various configurations of 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros.<sup id=\"fnr1-2017-06-12\"><a href=\"#fn1-2017-06-12\">1</a></sup> Multi-core performance has effectively <em>doubled</em> from the first generation of iPad Pro. That sort of year-over-year increase just doesn’t happen anymore, but here we are. The new iPad Pro gets a multi-core Geekbench 4 score of around 9200; the brand-new Core M3-based MacBook gets a multi-core score of around 6800. Again, this isn’t why people buy iPads &#8212; the iPad took off like a rocket in 2010 back when it was way slower (<em>way way way</em> slower) than even the slowest MacBook &#8212; but I think it is vastly underappreciated just how significantly Apple’s chip team is pulling ahead of the industry, especially Intel.<sup id=\"fnr2-2017-06-12\"><a href=\"#fn2-2017-06-12\">2</a></sup></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>All that said, the real story of these new iPad Pro models can’t be told today, because that story is iOS 11. I think iOS 11’s iPad-focused features are the entire reason why Apple waited until WWDC to unveil them. They could have held an event for them back in April, when they released the new starting-at-just-$329 9.7-inch iPad, but if they did, the only new software they could have demoed was Clips. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/03/21/new-apple-stuff\">I love Clips</a>, but it’s just a fun little tool and doesn’t show off anything particular to iPad compared to iPhone.</p>\n\n<p>Again, the new iPad Pro hardware is almost too good to be true, but the iPad story Apple unveiled last week is iOS 11.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not fair to review a product running a developer beta of the OS &#8212; let alone the <em>first</em> (and generally buggiest) beta. So let’s stop the “review” right here: the new iPad Pros running iOS 10.3.2 are the best iPads ever made. You shouldn’t hesitate to buy one today, and if you do, you <em>should</em> wait until iOS 11 ships in the fall to upgrade, or at the very least wait for a non-developer public beta of iOS 11 this summer before upgrading.</p>\n\n<p>But if you are reckless enough to install the iOS 11 beta on the new iPad Pro? Holy smokes is this better. I used the iPad Pro for a full week with iOS 10.3.2 because that’s the product that’s shipping, but after upgrading to iOS 11 beta 1 this morning and using it to write this entire review,<sup id=\"fnr3-2017-06-12\"><a href=\"#fn3-2017-06-12\">3</a></sup> I’m just blown away by how much more useful this machine is, and how much easier it is to work with 5 or 6 apps at a time.</p>\n\n<p>I would never recommend running a beta of any OS on any device that’s used for production purposes, so don’t take this as such, but for me personally, I can’t see going back to iOS 10.3.2 on any iPad that can handle it. It feels like a hand has been untied from behind my back, and this amazing hardware has finally been allowed to run free.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-2017-06-12\">\n<p>You can browse Geekbench&#8217;s database of results for <a href=\"https://browser.primatelabs.com/mac-benchmarks\">Mac</a> and <a href=\"https://browser.primatelabs.com/ios-benchmarks\">iOS</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2017-06-12\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-2017-06-12\">\n<p>Apple&#8217;s A10X chip is so high-performing that I think it&#8217;s put Apple in a slightly uncomfortable position marketing-wise.

I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a coincidence that the most impressive iPad demo during the keynote (and the one that contained the most bragging about its performance compared to PCs) was done by a third-party developer &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu59W1Pmq0U\">Ash Hewson of Serif, demonstrating Affinity Photo</a> &#8212; not Greg Joswiak or anyone else from Apple.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr2-2017-06-12\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn3-2017-06-12\">\n<p>Full disclosure: I went back to my Mac to write these 3 footnotes.

The iMac answers the need for a high end workstation and does so with arguably the most powerful device available, yet in a sleek all-in-one form factor. The iPad Pro finally (almost?!) puts the iPad in a position to be a laptop for the masses, especially those who grew up only on phones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sinofsky really gets this. I think he had an idea with Windows RT and the original Surface that – if Microsoft had had the gumption to fully commit to it – could have made the Surface a viable competitor to the iPad in this post-PC tablet space. They doomed themselves to failure by watering the strategy down by only going half-in, with the other half sticking with legacy compatibility with Windows for Intel. The iPad would have failed too if it was half a Mac. You can’t get anywhere with one foot in the new boat and the other foot in the old one.</p>\n\n<p>The other thing about the iPad Pro with the upcoming iOS 11 is that it’s not just for kids who grew up on phones, but for <em>anyone</em> for whom the complexity of Windows and even the Mac was too much to ever get comfortable with. There are adults who’ve spent two decades doing their work on computers without ever being comfortable with them until they switched to an iPad.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Steven Sinofsky’s WWDC 2017 Trip Report’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/06/12/sinofsky-wwdc-2017\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

I’m pretty sure it’s\nimpossible for any app to scan my iPhone for viruses or malware,\nsince third party apps are sandboxed to their own data, but let’s\nkeep reading…</p>\n\n<p>“You will pay $99.99 for a 7-day subscription”</p>\n\n<p>Uhh… come again?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There should be <em>no</em> &#8220;virus and malware&#8221; scanners in the App Store. None. iOS does not need anti-virus software. The App Store sandboxing rules mean that anti-virus software couldn&#8217;t really do anything useful anyway. And by allowing them to be listed on the store, it creates the false impression that Apple thinks you <em>might</em> need anti-virus software.</p>\n\n<p>But do-nothing anti-virus utilities that are scamming people into $100/week subscriptions? That&#8217;s downright criminal.</p>\n\n<p>Lin shows that &#8220;Mobile protection :Clean &amp; Security VPN&#8221; is not alone. The productivity top-grossing list is riddled with similar scam apps. </p>\n\n<p>Given how many legitimate developers are still having problems getting their apps approved due to seemingly capricious App Store reviewer decisions, it&#8217;s doubly outrageous that these apps have made their way onto the store in the first place. These are the <em>exact</em> sort of apps that the App Store review process should be primarily looking to block.</p>\n\n<p>And there is no excuse for Apple not having flagged them after the fact, once they started generating significant revenue. It&#8217;s downright mind boggling that this horrendous &#8220;Mobile protection :Clean &amp; Security VPN&#8221; app made it all the way into the top 10 without getting flagged.</p>\n\n<p>Based on Lin&#8217;s research, the pattern is simple:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Create a scammy utility app and get it into the store. Make it a free download with an expensive in-app subscription.</li>\n<li>Bid on common keywords like &#8220;virus&#8221;, &#8220;VPN&#8221;, and &#8220;wi-fi&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Get tens of thousands of downloads thanks to the top-of-results placement from the ad.</li>\n<li>Spring the in-app subscription prompt on your users and make money with a response rate of even just a fraction of 1 percent.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Apple needs to remove these apps from the App Store, and prevent such apps from getting into the store in the first place. They should reconsider the effects of allowing developers to buy their way to the top spot in search results. And they should police the top-grossing lists for apps that are pulling scams &#8212; the most important scams to catch are the successful ones.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, every single dollar these apps have generated should be refunded to the victims of these scams.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

The idea of creating a reason for people to come back to the App Store each day makes a ton of sense to me. And it will benefit both Apple and app developers. I like this move a lot.

Saint\nJohn was head of Global Consumer Marketing for Apple Music (and\npredecessor Beats Music). [&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>While Apple has several women of color in higher-ranking\npositions, Saint John had a high profile beyond Apple and was\nwidely praised for her on-stage work last year. She was also\nfairly unique among Apple executives in maintaining a strong\npersonal brand beyond her work identity, with a strong following\non Instagram and Twitter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So much for <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2017/05/27/ep-191\">my prediction on The Talk Show</a> that we&#8217;d see Boz on-stage again in the WWDC keynote.

After talking with the staff at the theater today, they recommended making all tickets general admission and allowing their ushers to fill the orchestra level first, and then direct remaining ticket holders to the balcony.

Given what happened Wednesday, I expect them to sell out in a few minutes. I hate writing that because it sounds braggy, but I&#8217;m putting it out there just as fair warning. You&#8217;re going to have to act quick and maybe get lucky.</p>\n\n<p>If you want a ticket and wind up not getting one, there will be a live audio stream for everyone to listen to. This year we are not going to attempt to stream live video. Instead we&#8217;re going to work hard to get edited video of the event up on the web as soon as possible after the show is over. If you just can&#8217;t wait, listen to the live audio. If you want to <em>see</em> the show, wait for the video &#8212; it should be up some time on Wednesday at the latest.</p>\n\n<p>If you do get a ticket or already have one:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>All seats are general admission, with no distinction between orchestra level and the balcony.</li>\n<li>Put your ticket in Apple Wallet and bring ID to show at the door. (If you don&#8217;t have an iPhone (?) bring a copy of the ticket PDF.)</li>\n<li>Doors open at 6p, and there will be an open bar. Find a seat, grab a beverage, and mingle with your fellow fans of the show.</li>\n<li>The show itself should start at 7p.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n    "

The Siri\nSpeaker seems like it will be a voice-controlled device in your\nhome that happens to be able to emit sound. But I think there’s a\ndifferent target Apple’s going after: <a href=\"https://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/what-is-sonos\">Sonos</a>. Remember, this isn’t\nrumored to just be a voice-controlled device with a speaker thrown\nin for audio feedback. Reports peg this as a device which contains\nmultiple, high-quality speakers. [&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>I would expect a device with seven tweeters to provide truly\nroom-filling sound, perhaps from all angles given that each of\nthose tweeters could be aimed in slightly different directions.\nThis might be something that could pair with an Apple TV and not\nonly play music but also play the audio for your TV shows and\nmovies. The Siri Speaker may be more of a living room device than\na kitchen device.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Man, this sounds like a great idea. Like Sonos but with really good AirPlay &#8212; like next-generation &#8220;AirPlay 2&#8221; AirPlay.

[&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>Raising the possibility of attacks by what he portrayed as\nfree-spirited Russian patriots, Mr. Putin said that hackers “are\nlike artists” who choose their targets depending how they feel\n“when they wake up in the morning. If they are patriotically\nminded, they start making their contributions &#8212; which are right,\nfrom their point of view &#8212; to the fight against those who say bad\nthings about Russia.” [&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps worried that American intelligence agencies could release\nevidence linking last year’s cyberattacks to Russia, Mr. Putin\nalso put forward a theory that modern technology could easily be\nmanipulated to create a false trail back to Russia.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/aodespair/status/870288487244718081\">David Simon nails it</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is a ridiculous fallback position, meaning: Cat&#8217;s out of the\nbag.

It&#8217;s impractical. I don&#8217;t know what your privacy settings are.\n   So if I point to your post, it&#8217;s possible a lot of people might\n   not be able to read it, and thus will bring the grief to me,\n   not you, because they have no idea who you are or what you\n   wrote.</p>\n\n<p>2. It&#8217;s supporting their downgrading and killing the web. Your\n   post sucks because it doesn&#8217;t contain links, styling, and you\n   can&#8217;t enclose a podcast if you want. The more people post\n   there, the more the web dies. I&#8217;m sorry no matter how good\n   your idea is fuck you I won&#8217;t help you and Facebook kill the\n   open web.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve made exceptions a handful of times over the years, but as a general rule I refuse to link to anything on Facebook either, for the same reasons as Dave. Last week <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/05/23/meeting-roger-moore\">I linked to <em>screenshots</em> of a Facebook post</a> to avoid linking to the original. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/marc.haynes.7583/posts/793204930854561?match=bWFyYyBoYXluZXMscm9nZXIgbW9vcmU%3D\">The original post</a> by Marc Haynes was public, which I know because I do not have a Facebook account, but <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2017/06/haynes-facebook.png\">here&#8217;s what it looks like for me</a> without being a Facebook user &#8212; a full one-third of my window is covered by a pop-over trying to get me to sign in or sign up for Facebook. I will go out of my way to avoid linking to websites that are hostile to users with pop-overs. (For example, I&#8217;ve largely stopped linking to anything from Wired, because they have such an aggressive anti-ad-block detection scheme. Fuck them.)</p>\n\n<p>You might think it&#8217;s hyperbole for Winer to say that Facebook is trying to kill the open web. But they are. I complain about Google AMP, but AMP is just a dangerous step toward a Google-owned walled garden &#8212; Facebook is designed from the ground up as an all-out attack on the open web. Marc Haynes&#8217;s Facebook post about Roger Moore is viewable by anyone, but:</p>\n\n<p><em>It is not accessible to search engines.</em> Search for &#8220;Marc Haynes Roger Moore&#8221; on any major search engine &#8212; <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=marc+haynes+roger+moore&amp;ia=news\">DuckDuckGo</a>, <a href=\"https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=marc%20haynes%20roger%20moore\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bing.com/search?q=marc%20haynes%20roger%20moore\">Bing</a> &#8212; and you will get hundreds of results. The story went viral, deservedly. But not only is the top result <em>not</em> Haynes&#8217;s original post on Facebook, his post doesn&#8217;t show up <em>anywhere</em> in the results because Facebook forbids search engines from indexing Facebook posts. Content that isn&#8217;t indexable by search engines is not part of the open web. (Even if I wanted to link to Haynes&#8217;s original post, how was I supposed to find it? I wound up with the original post URL via a Facebook-using friend who knows I prefer to link to original posts as a general rule.) The only way to find Facebook posts is through Facebook.</p>\n\n<p>Winer&#8217;s third reason:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>3. Facebook might go out of business. I like to point to things\nthat last. Facebook seems solid now, but they could go away or\nretire the service you posted on. Deprecate the links. Who knows.\nYou might not even mind, but I do. I like my archives to last as\nlong as possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Facebook going out of business seems unlikely. But Facebook pulling a Vader and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpE_xMRiCLE\">altering the deal</a>, blocking public access in the future to a post that today is publicly visible? It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if it happened tomorrow. And in the same way they block indexing by search engines, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.facebook.com/marc.haynes.7583/posts/793204930854561?match=bWFyYyBoYXluZXMscm9nZXIgbW9vcmU%3D\">Facebook forbids The Internet Archive from saving copies of posts</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Internet Archive is our only good defense against broken links. Blocking them from indexing Facebook content is a huge &#8220;fuck you&#8221; to anyone who cares about the longevity of the stuff they link to.</p>\n\n<p>Treat Facebook as the private walled garden that it is. If you want something to be publicly accessible, post it to a real blog on any platform that embraces the real web, the open one.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

They could have at least <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_surround\">linked to Wikipedia</a>. And Ming-Chi Kuo had a report with details of the device&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/05/01/apple-siri-smart-speaker-kgi-wwdc/\">excellent acoustics performance (one woofer + seven tweeters)</a>&#8221; a month ago.</p>\n\n<p>Gurman and Webb:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Inventec Corp., the Taipei manufacturer that already makes the\nAirPod wireless headphones, will add the speaker to its Apple\nrepertoire, the people said. Apple employees have been secretly\ntesting the device in their homes for several months, they said.\nThe Siri speaker reached an advanced prototype stage late last\nyear, Bloomberg News reported at the time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What does it look like?

Nine months before Apple unveiled them, Gurman had an accurate description of how they worked, the charging case, and even had the &#8220;AirPods&#8221; name (albeit with a &#8220;which may be what these are called&#8221; caveat, and with the wrong assumption that AirPods would be Beats-branded rather than Apple-branded). With this Siri speaker dingus, he&#8217;s a month behind and has far fewer details than either <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/05/13/kuo-wwdc-10-5-ipad-siri-speaker/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SonnyDickson/status/857584682677829633\">Sonny Dickson</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The closer we get to the WWDC keynote, the more likely things are <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2013/06/09/what-ios7-looks-like/\" title=\"Seth Weintraub’s preview of iOS 7 a few days before it was announced at WWDC 2013.\">to get spoiled</a>.

         },
         "content_html" : "\n<p>Here&#8217;s an idea I tossed out <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2017/05/27/ep-191\">on the latest episode of The Talk Show</a>, while talking with Jim Dalrymple about what Apple might do with the iPad Pro: what if they added a trackpad to the Smart Keyboard? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DaveChap/status/869192781960499200\">David Chapman took the idea and made a quick mockup of what it might look like</a>. (I think the trackpad should be smaller than in his mockup &#8212; more like an older MacBook than a new MacBook, but his image conveys the general idea.)</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m <em>not</em> talking about adding an on-screen mouse cursor to iOS for clicking and dragging. That&#8217;s a terrible idea. My loose idea for an iPad trackpad is based on a few things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>iOS&#8217;s trackpad-like mode for using the on-screen keyboard to move the insertion point around like a mouse cursor while editing text. A lot of people don&#8217;t know about this feature, and some who do misunderstand it, but it&#8217;s one of my favorite additions to iOS in recent years. If your iPhone has 3D Touch, while editing text you can hard press on the keyboard to turn it into a trackpad for moving the insertion point around in the text editing area. While in that mode, you can hard press again to change from moving the insertion point to selecting words (like double-click-then-drag on MacOS). iPads don’t (yet?) have 3D Touch, but you can access the same mode by putting two fingers on the on-screen keyboard and dragging. Two-finger touch on the keyboard and drag right away: move the insertion point. Two-finger touch on the keyboard, wait a moment for the insertion point to change to a barbell, and then drag: select words.</p></li>\n<li><p>tvOS&#8217;s UIFocusEngine. That&#8217;s the interface framework that allows Apple TV to be controlled by a trackpad or game controller <em>without</em> an on-screen mouse cursor. On Apple TV, you don&#8217;t move a cursor around, you move the selection around. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/11/13/uifocusengine-ios\">Two years ago Steven Troughton-Smith discovered that an incomplete version of UIFocusEngine was built into iOS 9</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>As things stand today while using an iPad with any hardware keyboard, selecting text and moving the insertion point around stinks. Yes, you can use the arrow keys on the keyboard (along with shortcuts like Option to move word-by-word instead of character-by-character, and Shift to select as you go), but it seems like a regression to 1983 to encourage an entirely keyboard-based routine for text editing. <a href=\"http://geekfun.com/2010/04/21/the-ipad-and-why-the-original-mac-didnt-have-arrow-keys/\">The original Mac didn&#8217;t even have arrow keys on the keyboard</a>, to force users to use the mouse for moving the insertion point.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In short, when you&#8217;re using the iPad&#8217;s on-screen keyboard, you have a crummy (or at the very least sub-par) keyboard for typing but a nice interface for moving the insertion point around. When you&#8217;re using the Smart Keyboard (or any other hardware keyboard) you have a decent keyboard for typing but no good way to move the insertion point or select text. Using your finger to touch the screen is imprecise, and, when an iPad is propped up laptop-style, ergonomically undesirable.</p>\n\n<p>A hardware keyboard with a trackpad could have just as good an interface for moving the insertion point and selecting text as the software keyboard. Even better, really, since you wouldn&#8217;t have to use two fingers or start it with a 3D Touch force press. And, a trackpad would make this feature discoverable. An awful lot of iPad owners &#8212; most of them, probably &#8212; don&#8217;t know about the two-finger drag feature on the on-screen keyboard.</p>\n\n<p>When you&#8217;re <em>not</em> editing text, the trackpad might not do much on an iPad. But the entire point of the smart keyboard is that you&#8217;re writing and editing text while it&#8217;s connected, or you&#8217;re just using it to prop up the iPad for watching video or something. But I think the trackpad could be used for selecting things or changing input focus. On the home screen you could use the trackpad to select an app to launch, just like on Apple TV. In split-screen multitasking mode, you could use a multitouch gesture on the trackpad to switch which pane has focus. Two-finger drags on the trackpad could scroll the current view, much like on the Mac.</p>\n\n<p>I fully admit this is not a perfect idea. But I do think it would greatly improve the efficiency of text editing on an iPad, and if text editing isn&#8217;t an essential task for iPad users, I don&#8217;t understand why Apple bothered making the Smart Keyboard in the first place. And, unlike adding touchscreen support to MacOS, adding trackpad support to iOS would not harm anything that is good about the way things already are.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest problem with this entire notion is that the way the Smart Keyboard folds from a cover to a keyboard would have to be redesigned, because the current design leaves no room at all for a trackpad. What I&#8217;m proposing might only be possible with a hard (non-folding) keyboard cover.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stephencoyle.net/ipad-trackpad/\">Stephen Coyle came up with a different idea</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The keys on the Smart Keyboard are very low profile, so it’s easy\nfor one’s fingers to glide over them. With this in mind, why not\nmake the entire top surface of the keyboard touch sensitive, then\nuse it in the same way as the software keyboard? All that’s needed\nis a way to toggle trackpad mode, and I think this is a perfect\nopportunity to ditch the &#8220;caps lock&#8221; key, and replace it with a\n&#8220;trackpad mode&#8221; key, which can be held down while using one’s\nother finger to move the cursor.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few reasons why I think this approach would be better\nthan a discrete trackpad. First, it requires no extra space, nor\nany major changes to the current design. Second, as mentioned\nabove, it maintains gesture parity with the current trackpad mode\non iOS. Third, it removes the expectation of a system-wide,\nmouse-style pointer, which I think a laptop-style trackpad would\ncreate. I think this is a significant consideration; a more\nprecise pointing device would be really useful on iOS for more\nthan just text entry, but I don’t expect this to come in the form\nof a mouse pointer. Thus, I think avoiding the suggestion of one\naltogether would lead to less confusion. With my proposed method,\npro users who need this functionality won’t take long to become\naware of it, and users who don’t need it won’t have what they may\nperceive as a half-broken laptop trackpad present at all times.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Coyle very nicely summarizes the most common objection I&#8217;ve heard to the idea of adding a trackpad to iPad keyboards: that adding a mouse pointer to iOS is a bad idea because when users see the trackpad they’ll expect a mouse cursor system-wide, not just while editing text.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe!</p>\n\n<p>But my gut tells me this concern is overblown. Even if users expect a mouse cursor when they first see the trackpad, they&#8217;ll adjust quickly when they realize it isn&#8217;t there. If they wanted a MacBook they&#8217;d be using a MacBook. By definition anyone using an iPad is not expecting it to act like a Mac. I do think <em>something</em> should happen when you move your finger(s) around the trackpad even when you&#8217;re not editing text, but tvOS shows that that <em>something</em> doesn&#8217;t need to be a mouse cursor moving around the screen.</p>\n\n<p>I have three objections to Coyle&#8217;s alternative solution. First, I think it would prove to be a technical challenge to create a touch-sensitive surface with Apple-quality latency and responsiveness that also doubles as a good surface for typing. The existing Smart Keyboard is rubbery for several reasons, but I don&#8217;t think rubbery can be used for a touchpad, and I think the gaps between keys would result in stuttery cursor movement. Second, making it a two-handed operation is clunky (and it would be two-handed for people who want to move the insertion point using their right hand). Third, making it a mode &#8212; even an easily toggle-able mode &#8212; feels like a bad idea. Modes aren&#8217;t always bad in UI design &#8212; the iOS software keyboard&#8217;s &#8220;move the cursor&#8221; feature is a mode &#8212; but it&#8217;s almost always better to avoid modality if you can. With a discrete trackpad, the keyboard is always the keyboard and the trackpad is always the trackpad. That&#8217;s better than a keyboard that is usually a keyboard but sometimes a trackpad.</p>\n\n<p>I say don&#8217;t overthink it. Just put a small trackpad under the keyboard for moving the insertion point around and Apple TV-style navigation. Simple.</p>\n\n\n\n    "
