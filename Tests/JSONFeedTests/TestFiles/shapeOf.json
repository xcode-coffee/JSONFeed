It&#39;s looking like a suicide.</p>\n<p>I was walking around Seattle last evening with friends, for happier reasons, and it was impossible to ignore the impact of Chris&#39;s death on the city. Every pub we entered was playing songs of his, sometimes a little Nirvana sprinkled in because that still hurts too. Temple of the Dog and Soundgarden shirts and jackets were out. The DJs on <a href=\"http://kexp.org\">KEXP</a> were constantly on the verge of tears, talking about Chris, suicide, and playing his music. </p>\n<p>As we sat down under some trees you could look up and see the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Space+Needle&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfuaDhsvzTAhVE8WMKHVdaC5gQ_AUICygC&amp;biw=1758&amp;bih=1290\">Space Needle</a> lit up. A few minutes later it went dark. Random people gathered on a corner, with a guitar of course, singing songs of his.</p>\n<p>On the way home there was a sign hanging from an overpass, the words <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qi8hhiYEQA\">Say Hello to Heaven</a> painted on.</p>\n<p>Chris Cornell will be missed.</p>\n",

Quite an interesting article about ‘how to survive as a solo dev’, but it was written by someone who was releasing their first game (presumably as ‘marketing’) and “haaaaaaang on”, I thought. Yes that’s impressive well done but it’s not exactly advice from someone who has been doing it for a decade and WAIT WAIT WAIT I’ve been doing it for a decade! I wonder what MY advice is to survive as a Solo Dev beyond one or two games.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think Dan&#39;s advice transfers very well to app development in general.</p>\n<p>You may notice that #1 on his list is &quot;Work from home&quot;, and I&#39;ve been working out of an office for a number of years (6-7 at this point?). As of yesterday, that&#39;s no longer the case.</p>\n<p>Last December we got an 8 month old puppy, and he wasn&#39;t quite ready to stay at home alone so I ended up not driving in to work a couple of a days a week. Turns out, I like working from home. No traffic to deal with, I can just pop upstairs for lunch, etc. So I decided that at the end of my lease, I just wouldn&#39;t renew. As the date got closer, I found that going into the office was really getting on my nerves and even though I still have a little over a month left on the rental, I&#39;m going to start working at home full time anyway.</p>\n<p>Why did I get an office in the first place? There were two main reasons. The first was that I was hiring employees and I didn&#39;t want folks coming to my home. The second reason was that I need to get out of the house. There were stretches of time where I didn&#39;t leave a three mile radius of my home for weeks and my wife said I was getting socially awkward. I wasn&#39;t getting out enough.</p>\n<p>I eventually decided that I&#39;m happier working alone and kept the office out of momentum. And I get out a lot more these days, so hopefully the social problem won&#39;t be one anymore. I hope.</p>\n",

This represents a fairly significant change for Swift developers (audited for nullability; shifted to properties in external interfaces where possible rather than methods; etc.). For Objective-C developers, this should be a fairly seamless transition (unless you were using the ivars that were previously exposed in the public interface, which you shouldn&#39;t have been doing, anyway!).&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/robertmryan\">Rob Ryan</a> did pretty much all the work on this release, so if you use FMDB in Swift, he&#39;s the guy to thank.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>On one hand, it&#39;s completely unreasonable to be posting requests for what I&#39;d like to see next week at <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/\">WWDC</a>. Really I should have made this list a year ago. But on the other hand, it&#39;s fun to do so here we go:</p>\n<p><strong>New Mac Pro Teaser</strong><br>It&#39;d be awesome if we got some sort of teaser about what&#39;s coming in the new Mac Pro. This is what I&#39;d like Apple to say: &quot;The 2018 Mac Pro is a quiet box with room to put things in, and it&#39;s not super expensive like the last one. Sorry about the last one by the way. Also, we decided that we would leave our desire to innovate on everything to other products. This new machine is pretty boring, but it&#39;s fast and boring and we know you appreciate that and you&#39;ve been waiting long enough as it is. This one has USB-C and the newest Thunderbolt though, unlike the last one. Again, sorry. But you&#39;ll like this Mac Pro for real this time. And here&#39;s a 48 bit, super wide gamut display to go with it.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Performance Tools for Core Image</strong><br>I&#39;d like to know where the bits for images I&#39;m drawing reside, how they got there, and how long it took to get there. Also, how much memory is that image taking up on the GPU? And what&#39;s the state of the caching that you&#39;re doing for me behind the curtains? Enquiring developers would like to know.</p>\n<p><strong>macOS Renamed to MacOS</strong><br>I know this is petty, but I can&#39;t stand seeing the lowercase M in the name. It&#39;s weak and screams of the late 2000&#39;s. Can we just pretend the lowercase didn&#39;t happen?</p>\n<p><strong>MacOS 10.13</strong><br>It&#39;s already showing up in web server logs, so I&#39;m sure 10.13 is around the corner. But what&#39;s going to be in it? I&#39;d like to see stability, performance, and better Siri integration. Some sort of neat iPad integration that&#39;s been rumored for a while now would also be awesome.</p>\n<p>I&#39;d also like to see APFS on the Mac, but I&#39;m scared of it to be honest. The switchover for iOS to APFS was easy because developers weren&#39;t allowed to do very much with the file system. On MacOS however, developers and users have been having their way with the file system for decades. There&#39;s going to be more than a couple of edge cases to take care of. I don&#39;t want to get burned.</p>\n<p><strong>Siri in a Speaker</strong><br>I&#39;ve got an Amazon Echo, and I love it. I&#39;d like to see what Apple&#39;s take is in this category.</p>\n<p>But- Apple is going to have to open Siri up a bit more. I want to be able to make triggers and actions for it. I want to be program my own commands into it, which might then talk back to my Mac or whatever else I want.</p>\n<p><strong>No More Cutesy Siri</strong><br>I&#39;d love to be able to turn off Siri&#39;s &quot;witty&quot; one liners and comments. It got old after the 3rd time, let me turn it off already.</p>\n<p><strong>Dynamic Swift</strong><br>Objective-C has a rich system for dynamically calling methods and forwarding messages to objects. I find it incredibly liberating to use, and I really wish Swift had something similar.</p>\n<p><strong>Xcode Improvements</strong><br>I&#39;d like it to be faster and crash less. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s too much to ask for.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The last time I was in San Jose Apple was introducing Aqua for the first time. San Jose is a sleepier town than San Francisco, but I think we&#39;ll all have fun anyway. Hopefully I&#39;ll see you there.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>There are two main reasons I like to go to WWDC. The first is to talk with Apple engineers down in the labs, and the second is to catch up with friends and make new ones if possible. Based on those criteria, I&#39;d say this WWDC was one of the best in recent memory.</p>\n<p>After a brief wait in line(s) for a particular lab, I was always able to get paired with an engineer on the relevant framework I had some questions about. In the past, this really only happened when I hit the Core Image labs (they know my face and name by now) but when I went down to the Metal labs with specific questions, I was hooked up with someone at Apple who had actually done what I&#39;m attempting to do. I can remember times in previous years where I would be shuffled around from person to person as I explained my problem, only to find out that the person I was looking for was in earlier that week and &quot;Sorry, here&#39;s a card please talk to our evangelist&quot;.</p>\n<p>Was it because the new location was closer to Cupertino? Or did I get lucky this time around? Whatever the reason, it was a happy change from previous years. Even randomly running into engineers in the hallways happened more often and provided fruitful conversations.</p>\n<p>But what about San Jose itself? The last time I was there was in 2000, again for WWDC. Developer Preview 4 dropped for us and we got our first look at Aqua earlier in the year. I don&#39;t have too many memories of it, but I do remember walking around with friends in the evening, trying to figure out what to do. We couldn&#39;t find much to do. It was pretty uneventful.</p>\n<p>Most developers I talked to before WWDC were pretty worried about San Jose, but pretty much everyone I talked to was satisfied by the end of the week.</p>\n<p>The best thing about WWDC in San Jose was that everything was so close together. The major hotels were only a few blocks away from the convention center. The Bash was a few more blocks away beyond that. There was even a climbing gym a few blocks away so I brought my shoes for a mid week break there. All the night time activities were close by as well. It was pretty awesome.</p>\n<p>The next best thing was that San Jose isn&#39;t crowded like San Francisco is. In San Jose you had a clear view of the sidewalks and you generally knew who was a developer and who was a local. And because it wasn&#39;t so crowded, you ran into people all the time. You didn&#39;t have to organize meetups, you just kind of went out and you knew you&#39;d run into someone to hang with.</p>\n<p>I really enjoyed it and I hope to go again next year.</p>\n<p>Oh, and the new Core Image stuff is pretty hot as well. I can&#39;t wait to start using that.</p>\n",
