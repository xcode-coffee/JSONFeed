      "content_html": "<blockquote>\n  <p>“Do you know Sarah? What do you think of her?”<br />\n“Oh she’s super smart. She’s on my Hire List.”<br />\n“What? You have a <em>Hire List?</em>”<br />\n“Of course. You <em>don’t</em> have a Hire List?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You should have a Hire List.</p>\n\n<p>Companies are people. Families are people. Crowds are people and markets are people. As complicated as it can make things, it all comes down to people.</p>\n\n<p>Given that, a lot of books about career and personal development focus on people. Meeting people, getting to know people, <em>“winning”</em> people. You must feed the beast of “Who You Know” by engaging Thought Leaders!</p>\n\n<p>Maybe that’s fine if thought leadership floats your boat, but investing in people doesn’t need to be contrived. All you need to do to get started is <strong>make a list of people you want to work with one day</strong>. People who would make good team members, people who inspire you. Keep it updated, and stay in touch with them. Then, slowly but surely, you can assemble your dream team.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"avengers-assemble\">Avengers, assemble</h2>\n\n<p>When I was getting close to graduating university, I started a spreadsheet of folks that might make good co-founders. I initially filled it with friends, but it was soon populated by ex-coworkers, fellow students, conference speakers, mentors – anybody in the Vancouver technology world that I thought I’d like to work with.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually <a href=\"https://www.allenpike.com/2016/cofounding-variables/\">I did find a co-founder</a>, but the list lived on with a new name: People to Work With. For years now it’s been an indispensable tool. While it was originally just developers, I’ve long since expanded it to all kinds of roles, even if Steamclock doesn’t have anybody in that role yet. <em>Especially</em> if we don’t have anybody in that role yet.</p>\n\n<p>It’s never too early to start keeping a list like this. By being able to refer great folks, you can be a more valuable team member <em>and</em> help shape your team for the better.</p>\n\n<p>Building your team may not be the most time-consuming part of leadership, but it’s the most important. You can either trust recruiters not to submit candidates that can’t fizzbuzz their way out of a paper bag, or you can take destiny into your own hands.</p>\n\n<p>Now, to be useful, your list should probably be more than just a series of names. At the minimum it should remind you why you want to work with each person, and ideally what they’re up to. If you want to take it to a Randsian level, you can grow it into a rolling <a href=\"http://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-recruit/\">database of folks to go for coffee with, complete with last-contacted dates and notes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of your approach, it’s almost always worthwhile to open up your List and pick somebody to catch up with. These people are on your list because they’re good at what they do, and even if you never do get a chance to work together, they each have something to teach you.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://imgur.com/Z7j5gPU\"><img src=\"http://www.allenpike.com/images/2017/neko-cats.jpg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>It’s worth remembering that as useful as making the List is for recruiting, it’s a worthwhile exercise in and of itself. In order to build a People to Work With List, you need to do the important work of thinking about what kinds of people you want to work with. Do you want people who succeed at all costs, or folks who enjoy teaching? Does your team need more clever people, more talkative people, or more inspiring people? Do you have enough rotund felines named after famous historical figures?</p>\n\n<p>Your Hiring List is also good place to start working on fighting the monocultures and underrepresentation that have crept into your existing team. It can be hard to rapidly change who is applying to your job postings, but you can rapidly change who you’re reaching out to, and who you’re investing time into staying in touch with. Whether you’re a CEO or a new hire, you can make a difference in who you work with every day, and the kind of team you’re building. So think about it.</p>\n\n<p>Who do you want to work with?</p>\n"

      "content_html": "<p>Earlier this month I was lucky enough to be invited to speak at the <a href=\"http://2017.ull.ie/\">Úll</a> conference in Ireland. One of the many bonus features there was Steve Stories, a project that invited some of the presenters to record our favourite stories about Steve Jobs.</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, when I think of Steve stories, my mind first goes to Andy Hertzfeld’s classic site about the creation of the Mac, <a href=\"http://www.folklore.org/\">folklore.org</a>, and the accompanying book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Revolution-Valley-Paperback-Insanely-Great-ebook/dp/B006BAW3N0/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0\">Revolution in the Valley</a>. My favourite stories from those early days are about Steve’s infamous Reality Distortion Field.</p>\n\n<div class=\"getty embed image\" style=\"background-color:#fff;display:inline-block;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;color:#a7a7a7;font-size:11px;width:100%\"><div style=\"overflow:hidden;position:relative;height:0;padding:67.508418% 0 0 0;width:100%;\"><iframe src=\"http://www.allenpike.com//embed.gettyimages.com/embed/80823324?et=dnftxZfaQ7VUZLL6N4l0BQ&amp;tld=ca&amp;viewMoreLink=off&amp;sig=xgGsT73DtRP0lTLV90TA2nyvflsB9QmfUV7FUCnwXyU=&amp;caption=true\" width=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"display:inline-block;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;\"></iframe></div><p style=\"margin:0;\"></p></div>\n\n<p>You see, in the early 80s when they were building the Macintosh, Steve was infamous for working the engineers <a href=\"http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=90_Hours_A_Week_And_Loving_It.txt\">disgustingly long hours</a> and putting them under extreme pressure to ship. Folks often threatened to leave, but if Steve wanted somebody to stay, they tended to stay.</p>\n\n<p>No matter how much a key engineer wanted to quit, if they went into Steve’s office to resign, he would always go into Reality Distortion mode and persuade them to feel like they wanted to stay. By the end of the conversation, the engineer would leave Steve’s office pumped and motivated. “Yeah, we <em>are</em> going to change the world! Wait… wasn’t I going in there to quit?”</p>\n\n<p>After some failed attempts at quitting, Burrell Smith, one of the key engineers behind the Mac, finally devised a way around Steve.</p>\n\n<p>“I’ve got it!” said Burrell. “I know the perfect way to quit that will nullify the Reality Distortion Field. I’ll just walk into Steve’s office, pull down my pants, and urinate on his desk. What could he say to that? It’s guaranteed to work.” The logic was sound.</p>\n\n<p>So he spends some time working up the courage to do this, and eventually makes his way to Steve’s office at the end of the day. He walks in, and Steve just asks, “Are you gonna do it?” Word had gotten around. “Are you really gonna do it?”</p>\n\n<p>Burrell looked Steve in the eye. “Do I have to? If I have to, I’ll do it.” He could tell by Steve’s expression that he didn’t have to. Burrell was free at last.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"tales-tall-and-true\">Tales tall and true</h2>\n\n<p>Though most modern-era Apple employees were never lucky – or unlucky – enough to meet Steve Jobs, colourful stories about Steve were often shared between team members. While folks often enjoyed pumping up the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/10/in-praise-of-bad-steve/246242/\">legends around Bad Steve</a>, I always liked the stories that humanized him.</p>\n\n<p>It’s been long said that when Steve Jobs would get into an elevator and see a rank and file employee, he would ask, simply, “What do you do?” An innocent enough question, on its face. However, given his years of accosting employees about their department’s shortcomings and the occasional summary firing, employees feared that you would be fired by the end of that elevator ride if Steve didn’t like your answer to “What do you do?”</p>\n\n<p>Reportedly a young designer at Apple had heard of this danger, and she was terrified of losing her job from such a chance encounter. She was newly pregnant and loved her job deeply, leading her to often rehearse in her head her answer – what if Steve Jobs ever asks “What do you do?”</p>\n\n<p>After one long day, she got in the elevator, and who else gets in, but Steve Jobs. Sure enough, he asks The Question and she’s off. She frantically launches into her elevator pitch, explaining her job, why her team is great, and she’s talking a mile a minute when Steve interrupts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Whoa, whoa, uh… I said, <em>“When are you due?”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They had a good laugh. I always liked these kinds of stories, the ones that push back on the idea that Steve was an unequivocal jerk, or worse that he succeeded <em>because</em> he was a jerk. While that makes for an interesting tale, it conflates the key skill – a critical eye – with one man’s intermittent hold on his temper.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-stories-that-matter\">The stories that matter</h2>\n\n<p>The stories we choose to tell about our leaders matter greatly. At a large company, employees’ mental model of their CEO can be even more important than the CEO’s actual behaviour. As Apple grew to tens of thousands of employees, Steve could never oversee every decision, or even a significant fraction of those decisions. Yet he was always there, in every meeting or argument, as <em>our idea of Steve</em>.</p>\n\n<p>When debating a UI approach or feature decision, the ultimate appeal to authority was, “What would Steve say?” “Would Steve ever let us ship this?” “Is this really good enough?” Through his famously demanding product reviews, he pushed down into the organization an understanding of what kind of work was acceptable at Apple, and how far it’s worth going to get something right.</p>\n\n<p>When Steve passed away in 2011, there was fevered speculation that Apple was doomed. “How could a company built by such an exceptional leader ever survive without him?” I was never really worried about that. He is truly missed, but his methods were not some secret recipe, held under lock and key. Apple employees had already spent years thinking like Steve.</p>\n\n<p>—</p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/agammell\">Adam Gammell</a>’s <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/il/app/steve-stories-%C3%BAll/id1215821983?mt=8\">Úll Steve Stories app</a> from the conference is now available on the App Store.

      "content_html": "<p>The status meeting is going well. Your demo was well received, the new feature is looking great, and you’ve been nailing your estimates.</p>\n\n<p>The product manager glances at her notes, and remembers one last thing. “Oh also, a lot of customers are asking for offline editing support on this screen.” Your eyes narrow, as they always do when you hear <em>offline</em> and <em>editing</em> in the same sentence. “The CEO’s asked us to prioritize it, so we’re going to go ahead and add it to 1.0.”</p>\n\n<p><em>Bwoooooosh…</em> time slows. The product manager has just lobbed a Scope Bomb. A threat to any project, the Scope Bomb is capable of causing great disruption and despair.</p>\n\n<p>“Uh…” You try to think quickly. “It does seem like a good addition, but…” You stare down the bomb as it sails across the boardroom table. “I’m not sure if two weeks is enough time though.” There, you said it. Your defense is mounted: they have been warned.</p>\n\n<p>“Oh, I’m sure you can do it,” the project manager smiles. <em>“I have faith in you.”</em> Aw, that’s a nice thing to say.</p>\n\n<p>“Thanks,” you hear yourself respond – and just like that, the bomb is armed. Unless somebody disarms it, in two weeks it will go off. Everybody except you will be surprised. This is bad.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.allenpike.com/images/2017/surprise.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>In project management, surprise is the enemy. All surprises are suspect, but bad surprises are the actual worst. They are, bar none, the most common cause of conflict and stress on projects. Whether you’re a project manager or a junior team member, everybody benefits if you work to avoid surprises.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, on most teams, people instead optimize for keeping up appearances. They give out optimistic estimates, assume that questionable approaches are being taken for good reasons, and <a href=\"http://calleam.com/WTPF/?p=1205\">green shift</a> status by under-reporting danger. They think, “Why worry them about the budget if we might still pull it off?” Shortcuts like these may make this week’s status meeting more pleasant, but they turn next month’s launch into a crunchy hell.</p>\n\n<p>You see, when potential problems lurk under the surface, decision-makers and managers <em>can’t do anything about them</em>. A team that’s off track early on can always be corrected. On the other hand, when the navigator is surprised by an iceberg, you’re gonna hit that iceberg.</p>\n\n<p>And so, in software, people are hitting icebergs all the damn time. Teams unexpectedly miss deadlines, architecture problems come to light at the last second, and Steve suddenly announces that his month-long vacation to Bora Bora starts tomorrow. God damnit Steve! Where even <em>is</em> Bora Bora? What the hell are we going to do now?</p>\n\n<p>Well, what we’re going to do is teach our team how to minimize surprises. Yes, the whole team. Having a skilled project manager on any team is valuable, but as with quality, surprise minimization starts with you.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ice-report-42-to-412n\">Ice report, 42 to 41.2N</h2>\n\n<p>The key to surprise minimization is – big shock here – communication. If there’s a problem in software development that isn’t somehow helped by better communication, I don’t know what it is. Perhaps cache invalidation.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, managers and other decision-makers get a lot of information thrown at them. They’re seeing status from everybody, they’re getting pressure from all sides, and just aren’t focused full-time on how your project is going. While it <em>is</em> their job to cut through this noise and focus on what matters, it’s <em>your</em> job to nominate potential problems and dangers for consideration.</p>\n\n<p>Now, these messages may not be fun to hear. An optimistic or distracted client may not absorb an early warning. Maybe you mention that Steve has vacation in April, but your CEO is “sure it will be fine.” It’s easy then, to lean back and feel absolved of your responsibility – whether or not anybody actually plans for Steve’s absence.</p>\n\n<p>The thing is though, your job isn’t to <em>say</em> something, it’s to <em>communicate</em> something. If, as April approaches, it’s clear that nobody is taking into account this huge hole in the development plan, the fact you  mentioned it once a few weeks ago doesn’t save anybody from hitting that iceberg, taking on 7 tons of water per second, and inspiring a profitable but tragic blockbuster film starring Leonardo DiCaprio.</p>\n\n<p>So leaders tend to miss potential dangers. Whether brought on by optimism or distraction, it’s a thing. That’s why the name of the game is – repeat after me – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt9c0UeYhFc\">repeat stuff</a>. If things are going to go wrong and nobody is doing anything about it, bring it up until they do something about it.</p>\n\n<p>Admittedly, repeating potentially unwelcome warnings can be uncomfortable or annoying, and a lot of us in software are conflict-adverse. Nobody wants to pick a fight or be antagonistic, so it helps to have an approach for this. Here’s one simple technique: <strong>raise the issue in the form of a question that points to a potential fix</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>While saying “This deadline still looks questionable” is easy enough to brush off or get generically defensive about, the question “What’s our plan if we miss this deadline?” requires the recipient to actually absorb and process the idea of maybe missing the deadline. Next time it seems like a warning isn’t being heeded, give it a try:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Since we probably won’t get all these features in, what are the lowest priority items in this list?</li>\n  <li>Have we announced this target release date to anybody, or is it just our internal goal?</li>\n  <li>How much time do you want us to spend attempting to hack around this limitation before it’s worth just building our own component for it?</li>\n  <li>Do you think you’ll have that budget authorization in by Friday, or should we be planning to pause development while we’re waiting for it?</li>\n  <li>Given how problematic these APIs have been in the past, can we put an extra week in the timeline for downtime and API regressions?</li>\n  <li>Do I get to run this place while Steve’s in Bora Bora?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Of course, you have to keep question-oriented pushback from devolving into   passive-aggressive “would you rather us ship a good product, or add your stupid hamburger menu that everybody hates” needling. You can call out issues without being a jerk.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, these kinds of early warning questions often motivate positive conversations about icebergs before things are tense and options are limited. Ask them early, and ask them often. Otherwise, chances are, your project is in for a titanic surprise.</p>\n\n"
